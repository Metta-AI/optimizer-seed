# Diagnosis binding — {{GAME_NAME}}

The core `diagnose` skill carries the method: signals → 2–4 varied,
mechanistic hypotheses, each pinned to a code location. This binding supplies
the game's failure vocabulary — the named ways policies lose here — and the
instruments for confirming which one is happening.

## Failure vocabulary

*(the concrete, named failure causes in this game — e.g. for a social game:
"missed a visible body," "voted without evidence," "killed with witnesses."
Specific enough that an episode can be classified against them)*

## Triage table

*(role/phase → the failure classes to check first, cheapest first)*

## Instruments

*(what this binding ships for confirming a mechanism: queries, trace flags,
analysis scripts — each with its CLI. Where instruments don't exist yet, the
agent builds them into `../../instruments/` as needs recur)*
