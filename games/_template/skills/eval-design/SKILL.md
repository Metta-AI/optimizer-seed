# Eval-design binding — {{GAME_NAME}}

The core `run-eval` skill carries the question→shape decision table and the
eval ladder. This binding sizes the rungs and names the game's knobs.

## Sensible rosters

*(for each common question — field eval, A/B arm, role-pinned probe,
crash-test — what the roster should look like here: how many seats, which
opponents, when to pin vs never)*

## Episode-count floors

*(informed by this game's variance: the smoke count, the directional count,
the verdict count. "Episode count is a calculation, not a habit" — show the
calculation or the variance evidence behind these numbers)*

## Role/seat pinning

*(what can be pinned in this game, when pinning helps a question and when it
masks the effect being tested)*

## Pacing

*(this game's episode duration and the batch pacing that avoids
contamination — sizes are game-specific; pacing discipline is universal)*

## eval_defaults.yaml

*(optional: if this mixin ships machine-readable defaults, document the
fields here)*
